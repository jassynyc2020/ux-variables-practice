Exercise One - Computing a lifetime supply of your favorite snack!

You just won a lifetime supply of your favorite snack. 
You are going to write a piece of code which will determine how much you
will actually need to last the rest of your life.

Follow the instructions to get the amount, putting your code after each instruction.

Remember to use descriptive variable names!
*/

// 1. Store your current age into a variable.
// Hint: let age = ...;
let myAge = 25;

// 2. Store a maximum age into a variable.
const maximumAge = 70;

// 3. Store an estimated amount per day (as a number).
// For example 1, for 1 bag of chips per day.
const estimatedNumberOfBags = 1;

// 4. Calculate how many you would eat total for the rest of your life.
// Store the result in a variable.
// Hint: There are 365 days in a year, multiply that by the number of years and the amount per day...
let lifetimeTotalNumberOfBags = 365 * estimatedNumberOfBags * maximumAge;

// 5. Create a variable called message describing your result.
// "You will need NN to last you until the ripe old age of X".
let message =
  "I will need " +
  lifetimeTotalNumberOfBags +
  " " +
  "to last me until the ripe old age of " +
  maximumAge;
// 6. console.log() your message.
console.log(message);

/*
Exercise Two - Calculating your future age.

You want to know how old you will be in any given year.  Create a piece of code that will computer
your age given your birth year and a year in the future. 
*/

// 1. Store your birth year in a variable.
const yearOfBirth = 1995;

// 2. Store a future year in a variable.
let futureYear = 2040;

// 3. Calculate your 2 possible ages for that year based on the stored values.
// For example, if you were born in 1988, then in 2026 you'll be either 37 or 38, depending on what month it is in 2026.
let myFutureAge = futureYear - yearOfBirth;

// 4. Create a variable called message which describes the result.
// "I will be either NN or NN in YYYY", substituting the values.

// 5. console.log() your message.

Exercise Three - Temperature Converter

Build some code which can convert from Fahrenheit to Celcius, and also from Celcius to Fahrenheit.

Based upon the method described here: https://www.mathsisfun.com/temperature-conversion.html
Celcius to Fahrenheit:  Divide by 5, then multiply by 9, then add 32
Fahrenheit to Celcius:  Deduct 32, then multiply by 5, then divide by 9
*/

// 1. Store a celsius temperature into a variable.
// Hint: let tempInCelcius = 32;

// 2. Convert it to fahrenheit and store that in a new variable.

// 3. Output to console.log() in the format "NN째C is NN째F".

// 4. Now store a fahrenheit temperature into a variable.

// 5. Convert it to celsius  and store that in a new variable.

// 6. Output to console.log() in the format "NN째F is NN째C."
